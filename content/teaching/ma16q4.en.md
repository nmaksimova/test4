## RStudio

To run Rmd files above and to compile (knit) them to pdf or other document format,
install RStudio > 1.0.

## R Resources

If you are new to R and RStudio, or more generally to programing languages,
the following short online material by Jenny Bryan is a good starting point.
It will help you streamline your daily workflow. It is important in particular
to understand the concept of "working directory" from the earliest stage of
your learning.

- [R basics, workspace and working directory, RStudio projects by Jenny Bryan](http://stat545.com/block002_hello-r-workspace-wd-project.html)

Need a more comprehensive guidebook? Here is a website I'd recommend:

- [R for data science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

Because of my intensive using of functions and operators defined in `dplyr`
and `tidyr`, my codes might look obscure for those who learned R years back
and haven't updated their coding style, and for those who don't have background
in (relational) database systems. [Chapter 5 of Grolemund and Wickham](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) will help.
